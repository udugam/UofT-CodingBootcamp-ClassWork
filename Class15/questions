1. From Walmart, what product do they sell the most in terms of quantity? Bannanas! They're perishable, cheap, usually at the front of the store.

2. I give you an array of 51 cards. Each card contains two properties: the suit, and the title (a string of either a number or a ranking: king, ace, so on).
Fifty-two cards form a deck. But I gave you 51. One is missing! How do you find it?
Try to come up with the most efficient steps to solve this.
Hint: Using a for loop against an array of values is not the most efficient solution--what if the cards aren't sorted?
- Create four variables that count the # of suits
- Create a variable that has the sum of a 52 deck card assigning values to each card from 1-13
- iterate through the given deck summing the numerical value of each card while incrementing suit variables
- at the end the difference in the sums is equal to the card that is missing
- this missing suit is it's suit.

3. Write a script that prints the numbers 1 to 100 in the console. 
But for multiples of three, print Fizz instead of the number. 
For multiples of five, print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print FizzBuzz.
